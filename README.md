# Dew Drop Mod Compat

Adds compatibility between The Dew Drop Project and other mods.

## Farmland Watering

This datapack adds the `dewdrop:waterable` tag to many different tested blocks from various mods.  
This allows **[Dew Drop: Watering Cans](https://modrinth.com/mod/dew-drop-watering-cans)** to hydrate these modded farmlands.
This tag also allows you to water blocks with the same methods added by **[Dew Drop: Sturdy Farmland](https://modrinth.com/mod/sturdy-farmland)**, water bottles, splash water bottles, and water buckets.
Note that this does not add the other farmland changes from Sturdy Farmland such as rain and daily decay, only the watering mechanics.
